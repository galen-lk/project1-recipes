# project1-recipes
Capstone project for the Odin Project section on introductory html

This is a demonstration of basic html skills- most notably, linking between different pages (relative addressing), image inclusion, and lists (both ordered and unordered). It uses basic headings (h1 and h3, somewhat by aesthetic preference), but otherwise uses default fonts, since no css is included yet.
